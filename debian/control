Description: Patch binaries generated by Intel C++ compiler for performance on AMD
 Utility to patch binaries generated by the Intel C++ compiler to get the maximum performance on AMD
 CPUs.
 The Intel C++ compiler adds to generated binaries a CPUID test that looks if they are executed on a
 Intel CPU, so the binaries don't run with full optimizations on non-Intel CPUs. This utility patches
 such CPUID tests, so the binaries can run on an AMD CPU as if they were on a Intel CPU.
 *Tested on Linux with Intel C++ compiler 10.1 (it may work with future releases of ICC).
 Maybe it also works with fortran compiler if it has the same CPUID test, but this is not
 confirmed.*
