<H1>Intel's compiler: is crippling the competition acceptable?</H1>

<p>UPDATE: new scripts are available for patching the compiler and/or the executables compiled with the
compiler. See <A HREF='#patches'>here</A> for details.

<p>FURTHER UPDATE 22/9/05: The scripts have been updated to patch a wider variety of Intel compiler versions.

<p>FURTHER FURTHER UPDATE 03/10/05: The scripts have been updated to cope with systems using different LANGUAGE
settings, and have been checked on the 64-bit compiler fce_9.0.027.

<p>FURTHER FURTHER FURTHER UPDATE 29/11/05: Those naughty people at
Intel keep changing the check code. The scripts have been updated to be
able to patch icc 9.0 20050430.

<p>AND ANOTHER 8/12/05: Sheesh, you'd think I'd have learned not to make schoolboy Perl errors by now. Fixed scripts to
correctly patch icc 9.0 programs.

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>A while ago I upgraded my copy of the Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux (to version 7.1.040, build 20040309Z).
All seemed well, and the code compiled with the new version passed all of our unit tests. However, when we moved
the new executables out to our compute farm they started segfaulting all over the place. What was going on?

<h2>The investigation</h2>

<p>The code in question is several hundred thousand lines of old-style poorly commented Fortran 77, with a bit
of C mixed in to make things more interesting. We've had problems before with compiler upgrades, so having the
new compiler produce code which didn't work wasn't completely surprising. However, this one seemed odder than
usual: the executables all seemed to pan out fine on the compile machine, but fail on the compute farm. Running
gdb indicated that they segfaulted in a routine called <i>__intel_cpu_dispatch_fail</i>, which wasn't enormously
productive. The stack trace showed which routine in our code led to the <i>__intel_cpu_dispatch_fail</i>
segfault, but it was a pretty simple routine and there wasn't anything obviously wrong with it.

<p>We've seen bugs with the Intel compilers before (and with other compilers too, I might add) where the
optimiser caused problems. Sure enough, compiling with all of the optimisation flags turned off produced
executables that ran perfectly fine across our collection of machines, albeit rather slowly. Reinstating the
optimisation flags one-at-a-time revealed that the -xK flag was the culprit: if that was specified, the
executables segfaulted on the compute farm, if not, they didn't.

<p>The -xK flag to the 'ifc' compiler specifies that SSE instructions should be used (the equivalent to gcc's
-fpmath=sse). If we compiled with -axK (produce both normal 386 code and SSE code and decide at runtime which to
use), then all was OK. So, it looked like some sort of bug with the SSE code emitted by the compiler, so I was
tempted simply to downgrade again and wait for the <em>next</em> version, which hopefully would have fixed the
bug.

<p>I cast a final eye over the last run on the compute farm, and noticed that while most of the machines
segfaulted on the -ax code, a few didn't. Interestingly, the ones on which the code worked were all
single-processor Pentium 4s, which the ones on which it crashed were all dual-processor Athlon MPs. Hmmm. It's
either an SMP bug or an AMD bug, and I was interested enough to try and work out which.

<p>Tracing the code up to the segfault on one of the Athlons, I found the smoking gun in an exponential routine:

<p><i>vmlsExp4</i> is (I managed to work out) the vectorised exponential routine. What this code does is check the
bits of a global variable. If it's 0x100 or greater, then call <i>vmlsExp4.I</i> (which contains SSE2 code), otherwise
if it's 0x80 or greater, call <i>vmlsExp4.H</i> (which contains SSE code), otherwise if it's 0 call
<i>__intel_cpu_indicator_init</i>, otherwise call <i>__intel_cpu_dispatch_fail</i> (which simply segfaults nastily by doing a
'movl   $0x1,0x0').

<p>Looking at <i>__intel_cpu_indicator_init</i>, it goes and checks the various processor capabilities and sets the
global variable at 0xedb375c to a value depending on the processor capabilities. If you can do SSE2, the value
is 0x200. If you can only do SSE1, you get 0x80, and so on. If you can't do anything, you get the value 0x1. What
is odd is that the Athlon chips can do SSE quite happily, but seem to end up with a value 0x1 anyway. Tracing
through the code on a P4 and an Athlon revealed the culprit (in <i>__intel_cpu_indicator_init</i>).

<p>The 'cpuid' call here puts the CPU manufacturer's ID in ebx:edx:ecx. The 'cmp' instructions later then check
that these values were 'Genu','ineI','ntel' (i.e. 'GeniuneIntel'). If not, then we jump off to a bit of code
that doesn't even pretend to check for the CPU capabilities but instead returns 0x1 (i.e it's a 386, and nothing
other than the bog-standard 386 instruction set is available).

<p>Think about what this means. The code produced by the Intel compiler checks to see if it's running on an
Intel chip. If not, it deliberately won't run SSE or SSE2 code, even if the chip capability flags (available
through the 'cpuid' instruction) say that it can. In other words, the code has been nobbled to run slower on
non-Intel chips.

<h2>Talking to Intel</h2>

<p>I raised this with Intel through their 
<A HREF="http://softwareforums.intel.com/ids/board/message?board.id=11&message.id=1583">compiler support
forums</A>. The initial response from Intel was that 

<p class="quote">The most recent update of 8.0 compilers should have fixed the run-time issue with -xW and -xK
on AMD processors.  I don't believe the fix has been carried back to 7.1.   It's not deliberate, it's an
oversight, due to AMD processors not being supported  or tested with those options.

<p> followed later (after some discussion) by 

<p class="quote">As Tim correctly pointed out, this was a bug introduced into the vector math library. It is
fixed in the current 8.0 compilers.  There are no plans to fix it for 7.1.

<p>It is worth noting at this point that Intel were in the process of phasing out support for their version 7.0
compilers given that the version 8.0 compilers has been available for some time, so while the 'no plans to fix
7.1' line was disappointing, it was perhaps not unexpected.

<h2>Home-brewed patches</h2>

<p>In the meantime, I'd seen enough performance gains with this version of the
compiler over the previous version that we had used (at least on the Intel chips)
to want to keep the upgrade. The solution? Patch the compiler! I wrote and made
available a <A HREF="intel_check_patch_7.1.gz">simple patch</A> for one of the
libraries included with the compiler which removed the 'GenuineIntel' check: any
CPU ID string would now pass. Code compiled with the patched compiler works fine on
both AMD and Intel chips because it can't tell the difference :).

<h2>The plot thickens</h2>

<p>Despite the fact that Intel were no longer officially supporting version 7.1 of
their compiler, they did in fact release a new version (version 7.1.044 build
20040901Z). I had a quick look at the code in <i>__intel_cpu_indicator_init</i> and
it hadn't changed, so Intel had obviously not addressed this 'bug'. However, when I
looked closer, I found something interesting. The code for vmlsExp4 looks like this
with build 20040901Z:

<DIV ID="code">

</PRE>
</DIV>

<p>Compare this to the code produced by the older build.

<TABLE class="bt">
<TR><TH>Version</TH><TH>SSE2 available</TH><TH>SSE available</TH><TH>SSE not available</TH></TR>
<TR><TH>Build 20040309Z</TH><TD>Run SSE2 code vmlsExp4.I</TD><TD>Run SSE code vmlsExp4.H</TD><TD>Segfault</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<p>Remember that non-Intel chips are found to have no ISA extensions available
regardless of whether that's correct or not, so they fall into the last column.
Also note that if the code was compiled with the -axK flag (i.e check if SSE is
available and only use it if it is), then vmlsExp4 is never called in the first
place on non-Intel chips, which are forced to go off and run 386 legacy
non-vectorised code.

<p>So, it looks like Intel did indeed address the bug of code compiled with -xK
crashing on Athlon machines due to their nobbled CPUID check. However, they didn't
fix it by removing the CPUID check, they fixed it by removing the 'is SSE
available?' check. Note that nobody is going to release production code compiled
with -xK, as even in the new version it will indeed crash if run on an old Pentium
with no SSE support. Production code will be compiled with the -ax flags, and this
won't even attempt to use any SSE/SSE2 instructions on non-Intel chips.

<h2>Is version 8 any better?</h2>

<p>We've now upgraded to version 8.1 of the Intel Fortran Compiler as it now
compiles our code more-or-less successfully. I was hardly surprised when I
inspected the code for <i>__intel_cpu_indicator_init</i>: it's more complicated
than it was in version 7 (checking for SSE3 support, among other things), and all
of the math intrinsics have SSE3 equivalents added, but the checking for
'GenuineIntel' is still present. One difference is that Intel now openly admit that
SSE3 functions are available only for Intel chips, but as far as I am aware it is
not explicitly mentioned that code compiled with the -ax flags will not use any
vectorisation on non-Intel processors and that SSE/SSE2 vectorisation is crippled
on non-Intel processors.

<h2>Benchmarks beware</h2>

<p>In many of not most benchmarks, the Intel compiler produces the fastest code of
any F77/F90 compiler.  However, care needs to be taken on non-Intel chips. Code
compiled with -axW, for example, will not use ANY SSE or SSE2 instructions on
non-Intel chips. This will almost certainly greatly impact performance. If the use
of SSE2 is forced with -xW (which is what Intel sort-of-recommend for Opterons),
then some SSE2 code will be used (as the code in the main program will use SSE2
instructions), but calls to the vectorised single-precision math instrinsics will
use SSE, not SSE2.

<p>In most of not all cases, then, code compiled with the Intel Fortran Compiler
(and presumably icc as well, although I haven't tested it) will run slower than it
should on non-Intel CPUs due to deliberate targeting of non-Intel CPUs by the
compiler engineers. Benchmarks comparing the performance of AMD and Intel CPUs
should beware of using the Intel compilers for this reason.

<p>As an example, some (internal) code was compiled with ifc version 8.1.028 build
20050520Z twice. For the second compile, the Intel CPU check was patched out of the
compiler and replaced with a no-op. The code is otherwise identical, compiled with
'-O3 -fpp -tpp6 -ip -pad -w95 -cm -Vaxlib -static-libcxa'. The machines used are a
dual-Opteron 248 and a P4 1.7 GHZ, values are seconds (lower is better, and note
that the 'confs' test has a stochastic element and hence the times can vary by ~5%
between runs).

</TABLE>

<p>The results for all unit tests of the software were identical between the
original and patched versions. As can be seen, patching out the 'GenuineIntel'
check makes no difference to the P4, but increases the performance of the Opteron
by up to 10%. If the code was compiled with '-axW', then the Opteron really
suffers: the 'Simplex' test is more than two times slower (it uses lots of exp()
calls, and hence really benefits from vectorisation).

<A NAME="patches">
<h2>Patch-the-compiler redux</h2>

<p>I like my little cluster of Athlons, and I also like ifc version 8.1 because
the code it produces is faster than the code from ifc7. I hereby make available
two little Perl scripts to fix the problem: this one <A
HREF="intel_check_patch.gz">patches the compiler</A> to remove all references
to 'GenuineIntel', so that any executables compiled with the compiler will not be
artificially crippled on AMD chips. The script has been tested with compiler
versions 7.1.040, 8.1.028 and 9.0.024, and should work on other builds. It should
also work on the EM64T version of the compiler (thanks to Craig Wiegert), and with
the Intel C compiler, but hasn't been properly tested on that (if you can test it
on ICC please do so and let me know!)

<p>Patching the compiler is arguably against the terms of the EULA (it's a gray
area), and you might not have permission (either UNIX permission or managerial
permission) to do so. So, there's also a script to <A
HREF="intel_check_executable_patch.gz">patch executables</A> compiled with the
Intel compilers. Enjoy!

<p>If someone comes across a version of ifc/icc for which these scripts don't
work, please contact me and I'll update them. Both scripts may be freely modified
and redistributed.

<p><b>UPDATE</b> 22 Sep 2005: the scripts from the above links have been updated
to patch a wider variety of intel compiler versions. If you downloaded and used them
before, I would urge you to get the new versions and use those instead. I get the feeling
that new versions of the compiler are deliberately using different registers etc. to 
check the CPUID just to make these patches fail :). The question is, can I update
the patches as fast as they update the compiler?

<p><b>Further Update</b> 03 Oct 2005: fixed a minor bug on systems with different LANGUAGE
settings. The executable patch script has been tested on the 64-bit compiler version fce_9.0.027.

<p><b>Further Update</b> 27 Nov 2005: fixed to be able to patch icc 9.0
build 20050430 (uses a different register for the check)

<p><b>Further Update</b> 8 Dec 2005: fixed silly bug which meant some icc 9.0
programs weren't patched fully.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>It is a shame that the Intel compiler, which use to be almost the no-brainer choice
if your primary concern was fast code, is now being coerced into being a marketing
tool. Crippling the output for non-Intel chips may mean that some published
benchmarks may end up bogusly favouring Intel over AMD, but the cost is that if you
want to release fast production code I can't recommend the (unpatched) compiler.
There are an awful lot of AMD machines out there!

<p>To Intel: there is a standard mechanism out there (invented by you!) for
questioning a CPU as to its capabilities. You should be using that, not checking
for the presence of your trademark. I don't expect Intel to support AMD-specific
extensions, and I also don't expect Intel to have to test its compiler on AMD CPUs.
However, if a CPU states that it can do SSE3 or whatever then I expect the code
produced by the Intel compiler to use SSE3 instructions rather than to check first
if the chip was made by Intel. It was not acceptable for Microsoft to go out and
deliberately cripple Windows under DR-DOS, and likewise it isn't acceptable for you
to cripple a product that you sell for not inconsequential sums of money so that it
won't perform properly on competitors' hardware.
